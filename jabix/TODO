Features to be added:
* Background statistics/ TMB per sample/ callable loci => given vcf, bed (theoretical coverage), BAM (realistic coverage), return mutation burden
#https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_coverage_CallableLoci.php
* Extract sequence flanking a mutation position, given genome
* Mutation signature? refer cosmic
* Gene/CDS/Region annotation??
* Variant selection for particular feature in GTF
* MultiVCFReader -> sample variant matrix, recurrence calculation, genome/feature mutation clustering algorithm implementation
#Primary step for DOMAIN like analysis


Features available:
Annotated variant (VCF) file parsing / VEP, CSQ
BAM based variant features
